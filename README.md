This is the front end and back end server for Project 5 of the Web Developer path.

### Back end Prerequisites ###

You will need to have Node and `npm` installed locally on your machine.

### Back end Installation ###

Clone this repo. From the "back" folder of the project, run `npm install`. You 
can then run the server with `node server`. 
The server should run on `localhost` with default port `3000`. If the
server runs on another port for any reason, this is printed to the
console when the server starts, e.g. `Listening on port 3001`.


## Final result

Then, you need to open the index.html file. The products should appear as following :

In this project, I use Javascript with no Frameworks. I use the API run by the backend server to retrieve data with async/await. I use the localStorage to stock the customer's cart.
On the cart page, you can modify the quantity of each product on your cart.
